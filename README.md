# Reqres.in API Test Logger

This is a simple React app that shows how to work with the [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) API. The app walks through creating, updating, fetching, and deleting a user, and displays each step in a clear log so you can see exactly what’s happening.

## What This App Does

- **Creates a User:** Sends a request to add a new user.
- **Updates the User:** Changes the user’s job title.
- **Fetches the User:** Gets the user’s details.
- **Deletes the User:** Removes the user.
- **Checks Deletion:** Confirms the user is really gone.
- **Shows a Log:** Lists every action and result as they happen.

## How to Run the App
